# Credit-Card-Dataset-Analysis-using-KNN-and-DecisionTreeClassification
In this project, two well-known machine learning grouping algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree Classifier—are used to analyze a credit card dataset. Based on a number of transactional characteristics, the study aims to forecast whether a particular credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
